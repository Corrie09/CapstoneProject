      "Distinct values for essay0 (n=54347): [\"about me:  i would love to think that i was some some kind of intellectual: either the dumbest smart guy, or the smartest dumb guy. can't say i can tell the difference. i love to talk about ideas and concepts. i forge odd metaphors instead of reciting cliches. like the simularities between a friend of mine's house and an underwater salt mine. my favorite word is salt by the way (weird choice i know). to me most things in life are better as metaphors. i seek to make myself a little better everyday, in some productively lazy way. got tired of tying my shoes. considered hiring a five year old, but would probably have to tie both of our shoes... decided to only wear leather shoes dress shoes.  about you:  you love to have really serious, really deep conversations about really silly stuff. you have to be willing to snap me out of a light hearted rant with a kiss. you don't have to be funny, but you have to be able to make me laugh. you should be able to bend spoons with your mind, and telepathically make me smile while i am still at work. you should love life, and be cool with just letting the wind blow. extra points for reading all this and guessing my favorite video game (no hints given yet). and lastly you have a good attention span.\"\n",
      " \"i am a chef: this is what that means. 1. i am a workaholic. 2. i love to cook regardless of whether i am at work. 3. i love to drink and eat foods that are probably really bad for me. 4. i love being around people that resemble line 1-3. i love the outdoors and i am an avid skier. if its snowing i will be in tahoe at the very least. i am a very confident and friendly. i'm not interested in acting or being a typical guy. i have no time or patience for rediculous acts of territorial pissing. overall i am a very likable easygoing individual. i am very adventurous and always looking forward to doing new things and hopefully sharing it with the right person.\"\n",
      " \"i'm not ashamed of much, but writing public text on an online dating site makes me pleasantly uncomfortable. i'll try to be as earnest as possible in the noble endeavor of standing naked before the world.  i've lived in san francisco for 15 years, and both love it and find myself frustrated with its deficits. lots of great friends and acquaintances (which increases my apprehension to put anything on this site), but i'm feeling like meeting some new people that aren't just friends of friends. it's okay if you are a friend of a friend too. chances are, if you make it through the complex filtering process of multiple choice questions, lifestyle statistics, photo scanning, and these indulgent blurbs of text without moving quickly on to another search result, you are probably already a cultural peer and at most 2 people removed. at first, i thought i should say as little as possible here to avoid you, but that seems silly.  as far as culture goes, i'm definitely more on the weird side of the spectrum, but i don't exactly wear it on my sleeve. once you get me talking, it will probably become increasingly apparent that while i'd like to think of myself as just like everybody else (and by some definition i certainly am), most people don't see me that way. that's fine with me. most of the people i find myself gravitating towards are pretty weird themselves. you probably are too.\"\n",

      " 'hello! i enjoy traveling, watching movies, and hanging out with friends. my #1 rule for traveling is to go to places where where i can drink the tap water. =p i\\'ve been to japan, washington dc, new york, london, paris, china (an exception to rule #1) and many other places. for the year, i haven\\'t decided yet. maybe toronto and montreal. my taste in movies (and television) fall into three genres: comedies, action, and drama. it doesn\\'t matter if the film is in english or sub-titled (i can\\'t stand dubbed), but it has to be well-written. aside from the traveling and movies, i also enjoy broadway shows (4 shows in 5 nights in vegas a couple years ago), bay area sports (except the sharks), online gaming, good food, and keeping up with current events.  my friends would describe me as easy-going, goofy, thoughtful, consistent, honest, and dependable. i can get serious when i have to be. overall, i like to think that i lead my life by doing what is \"right\".'\n",

      " 'is it odd that having a little \"enemy\" status with someone, makes them seem more interesting to me?  i\\'m an extremely socially-graced outcast. my totally awkward childhood surprisingly yielded to something extroverted, thoughtful and diplomatic. i\\'m a nice guy, i love people, i love humanity, and i can get pretty angry about all of the above. if i end up the loudest guy in the room, i\\'m never so loud that i cant hear what anyone else is saying.  though i am often inappropriate and desperately unable to pass up a joke, no one has ever punched me. i think too much, and talk to much, but know when to shut the f up.  for the sake of accurate representation, i\\'m going to qualify my \"average\" body type as a bit of muscle and a bit of fat. note: i have recently become an ebook-reading-cardio-addict. now that i can jog and read oversized print at the same time i can\\'t stay away from a treadmill. seriously, 4+ books, 60+ minutes 4+ times a week for 6 weeks and counting.']\n",
